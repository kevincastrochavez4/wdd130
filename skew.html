        I started by looking around for examples of non-rectangular containers
        that allowed text to flow naturally inside of them. I assumed it'd be
        possible with CSS since programs like Adobe Illustrator and Microsoft
        Word have been doing it for years. I found the CSS Shapes Module and
        that works very well for simple text content. It can even full justify
        the text. However it doesn’t allow content to scroll within the
        container so as the user scrolls down, the entire slanted container
        appears to move left, which wasn’t the effect I wanted. Instead I took a
        simpler approach and simply added a transform: skew to the container:
      </p>
      <p>
        That was a good start, scrolling worked as expected and resizing was
        handled with only CSS, but the obvious problem is that now the text and
        images are slanted as well. I made a few attempts to solve this with CSS
        but eventually came up with an even simpler solution: create a new font
        with the reverse slant using FontForge, an open-source font editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd chosen Roboto Condensed Light for the site's main content so I
        opened the .ttf file in FontForge, selected all the glyphs, and applied
        a skew of 14 degrees to compensate for the container’s slant, and saved
        it out as Roboto-Rev-Italic.ttf.
      </p>
      <p>
        That worked great for text, even selecting functioned normally. For
        images and video, which are display:block elements I was able to simply
        apply the reverse slant to their transform property. Pseudoelements
        background give them to span the entire width of the container as well.
